  <h4> Unicorn, mythological animal resembling a horse or a kid with a single horn on its forehead.<br>
     The unicorn appeared in early Mesopotamian artworks, and it also was referred to in the ancient<br>
      myths of India and China. The earliest description in Greek literature of a single-horned <br>
      (Greek monokerōs, Latin unicornis) animal was by the historian Ctesias (c. 400 BCE), who related<br>
       that the Indian wild ass was the size of a horse, with a white body, purple head, and blue eyes,<br>
        and on its forehead was a cubit-long horn coloured red at the pointed tip, black in the middle,<br>
         and white at the base. Those who drank from its horn were thought to be protected from stomach<br>
          trouble, epilepsy, and poison. It was very fleet of foot and difficult to capture. The actual animal<br>
           behind Ctesias’s description was probably the Indian rhinoceros.</h4>
